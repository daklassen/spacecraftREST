## SpacecraftREST

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/daklassen/spacecraftREST.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/daklassen/spacecraftREST)

Project for learning to create a REST service with Spring. I used [this great guide](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/bookmarks/) as a refrence.

### Quickstart Intellij

Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/daklassen/spacecraftREST
```
Change the directory:
```
cd spacecraftUI
```
Build the Intellij project with gradle:
```
gradlew cleanidea idea
```
Now you can open the generated Intellij project and start working on the projekt.

### REST documentation

You can reach the documentation (generated with swagger) with: 
> http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
